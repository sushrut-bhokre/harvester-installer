# zeus-installer

Repository for building the Zeus ISO image. This includes all the scripts, configurations, and the interactive installer console used during system installation.

The `zeus-installer` works in conjunction with the `zeus-edge` repository to provision and deploy a complete Zeus cluster environment.

---

## Overview

The Zeus Installer is an interactive console-based installation system that runs when the Zeus ISO is booted. It allows users to configure and deploy a node into a Zeus cluster with guided inputs.

The installer supports both:
- Creating a new cluster
- Joining an existing cluster

It handles system provisioning, configuration, and initialization of the Zeus environment.
